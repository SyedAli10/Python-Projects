# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO Ludo

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO A playable dice game with certain rules

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO The project's goal is to use Python's Pygame package to create a digital version of the beloved board game Ladder and snake. With the help of the programme, players will be able to virtually experience the classic games, complete with token movements, dice rolling, and board movements. It will have features including an easy-to-use graphical user interface, four player multiplayer support, dice rolling, token movement based on die rolls, and rule enforcement—that is, the ability to capture opponent tokens and cross the finish line. The execution entails building the game board, constructing and animating the tokens, handling dice rolls, implementing game logic, adding player turns, and utilising Pygame's features for graphics, sound, and user interactions to provide a visual depiction of the gaming. Through clicks or keyboard inputs, players will be able to interact with the game through an interface that shows player information, dice rolls, and the current state of the game. Players will have an entertaining and dynamic method to relive the original ladder and snake game experience on a digital platform with this game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable I am not combining 1051's final project with any other course final project

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable I am working alone

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO A good outcome for a Ladder and snake game project could be: Implementing core gameplay mechanics, including player turns, dice rolling, token movement, and win conditions, while ensuring a functional and visually engaging user interface.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO1. These are the things I hope to accomplish for my final project: Implement multiplayer functionality, enabling online gameplay among multiple users, Create an interactive user interface with engaging graphics and animations, Incorporate an AI opponent for single-player mode, Develop robust game logic that includes all the rules of Ladder and snake, Enable customizable game settings for players to modify game parameters, Ensure responsive and intuitive user experience across various devices, Implement sound effects and music for an immersive gaming experience.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO The best outcome for the Ladder and snake game project would be a fully functional, visually appealing game with multiplayer capabilities, intelligent AI opponents, smooth animations, interactive dice rolling, adherence to the game's rules, and an intuitive user interface that ensures an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience for players before the final project's deadline.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO My next steps will be to explore game programming with Python and the Pygame module in order to advance the Ladder and snake game project. My knowledge of event handling in Pygame, graphical user interface (GUI) design, and game logic will need to be improved. It will be essential to develop your abilities in player interactions, game rules implementation, and graphic design. It will be essential to look through Pygame's documentation for information on particular features and possible optimisations. Since I'm working alone, I'll be in charge of everything—from designing the user interface to developing the game's features to diagnosing and debugging any issues that may come up. Since cooperation is out of the question, I'll concentrate on learning the skills I need on my own to finish this Ladder and snake game project.
