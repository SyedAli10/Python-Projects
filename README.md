I have faced a lot of difficulties making this ladder and snake game like fitting the background image to the size of pygame but I was able overcome that obstacle but the were still a lot of things like making the players follow the path of the background image and making the mclimb up the ladders or making thenm slide from the snakes correctly but it still works sometimes 
Also I really enjoyed adding the players and Explored ways to structure code for better readability, maintainability, and extensibility.
Also, I Learned to handle user input gracefully, providing a smoother user experience.
Also, Designing an efficient algorithm for dice rolling, player movement, and detecting ladder and snake encounters posed an initial challenge
which I am still not able to do for some parts.
